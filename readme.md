# TwisterMc's Beaver Builder Modules

This is a free plugin for Beaver Builder that I'll be adding my custom modules to.

## Modules
### Slick Slider
My first module is a Slick slider module. The carousels that come with Beaver Builder are OK, but they leave a lot to be desired. That's why I'm integrating Slick.

## Release Notes

### Version 0.6.4
* Initial support for video slides.

### Version 0.6.3
* Fixing focus states for prev/next buttons and play/pause.

### Version 0.6.2
* Fixing embarrassing PHP errors.

### Version 0.6.1
* Added a link option to the full width image module.

### Version 0.6
* Added a new module for full width images.
* Adding up/down arrows for vertical carousels.

### Version 0.5
* Added vertical carousel mode.
* Re-worked the carousel inits to ensure the right number of dots show when scrolling by more than 1.
* Hiding the slidesToScroll setting if centerMode was true.

### Version 0.4
* Added the ability to style the arrows and dots.

### Version 0.3
* Pulling in the slick.js locally.
* Updating slick.js with a fix for [issue 1207](https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/issues/1207)
* Updating the carousels to be self contained so that we can put multiple on one page.

### Version 0.2
Reorganization of the settings panel and hiding/showing fields as needed.

### Version 0.1
First! The code is very rough and it's not ready for prime time. Slick is integrated and working with a bunch of options. This is the starting point, more to come.
