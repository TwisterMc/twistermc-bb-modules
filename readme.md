# TwisterMc's Beaver Builder Modules

This is a free plugin for Beaver Builder that I'll be adding my custom modules to.

## Modules
### Slick Slider
My first module is a Slick slider module. The carousels that come with Beaver Builder are OK, but they leave a lot to be desired. That's why I'm integrating Slick.

## Release Notes
### Version 0.4
* Added the ability to style the arrows and dots.

### Version 0.3
* Pulling in the slick.js locally.
* Updating slick.js with a fix for [issue 1207](https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/issues/1207)
* Updating the carousels to be self contained so that we can put multiple on one page.

### Version 0.2
Reorganization of the settings panel and hiding/showing fields as needed.

### Version 0.1
First! The code is very rough and it's not ready for prime time. Slick is integrated and working with a bunch of options. This is the starting point, more to come.
